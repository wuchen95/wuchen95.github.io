[^_^]:    My research aims to improve language understanding in tody's information retrieval systems, towards building the next-generation information assistant systems that can help people access the world's knowledge in seamless ways. To achieve my goals, I combine advances in deep learning and NLP with insights from information retrieval and large-scale distributed systems. The methods I developed enable information retrieval systems to understand people better, retrieve more accurate documents, and present results in more natural ways.
